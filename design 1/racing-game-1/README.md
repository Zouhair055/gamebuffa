# Racing Game

## Overview
This racing game is an interactive experience that combines neural networks and genetic algorithms to create intelligent cars that race on a dynamically generated track. The game features a polished design inspired by classic racing games, complete with a main menu and engaging animations.

## Features
- **Neural Networks**: Each car utilizes a neural network to make decisions based on its environment, allowing for adaptive gameplay.
- **Genetic Algorithms**: The game employs genetic algorithms to evolve the cars over generations, improving their performance as they learn from previous races.
- **Interactive Interface**: A user-friendly interface with a main menu that allows players to start the game easily.
- **Dynamic Track**: The racing track is generated with boundaries that the cars must navigate, adding a layer of challenge to the gameplay.
- **Animations**: Smooth animations enhance the visual appeal, making the racing experience more immersive.
